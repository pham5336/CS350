# Git Fork Exercise

## Goal

Learn how to create a personal copy of a repo from someone else.

## Overiew

Github is a web service that manages Git repos. 
So far we have created a local copy of the repo and pushed any changes made to a copy of 
the repo in our Github account.  

This only allows you to make changes to the repo when you
have write permissions. You are unable to push your changes directly to someone else's repo.

In order to push changes you must clone the original repo.  
Now you have an independent version of the repo that you are allowed to push to.
This process is called "Forking" and allows for the two repos to have very different
futures.

This repo can be cloned on to a local computer.  You can add commits locally and then 
push your changes to the remote.  The specific steps are shown for our class repos.

In a later exercise we will show how to get your changes from the forked repo to the 
original using a Pull Request.


## Steps

Browse to Github.  Login to github with your personal student account.

Browse to https://github.com/UNC-CS350/CS350

Find the "Fork" button in the upper right.  Click it to clone your copy.

Make changes to the repo.  Verify that they took hold.

Now go to the https://github.com/UNC-CS350/CS350.   Verify that your recent changes are not
there.

Clone this the forked repo onto your laptop using HTTPS.

Change some files.  Commit them to Git.  Push the changes to the forked CS350.

Verify that your changes are visible at https://github.com/student-account/CS350

Now go to the https://github.com/UNC-CS350/CS350.   Verify that your recent changes are not
there.

Login to the Github Account for UNC-CS350.

Go to the CS350 repo.

Create a file in the "Exercises/Results/yourid" folder named "FORK_DONE".

When I see this file you will get credit for the exercise.
