# Git Pull Request Exercise

## Goal

Learn how to create a pull request to share code with someone else.

## Overiew

Github is a web service that manages Git repos. 
So far we have created a local copy of the repo and pushed any changes made to a 
copy of the repo in our Github account.

Then we forked a repo that someone else controls to create a copy of the repo that
we can push changes to.

We do not yet have a way to share our changes back into the original repo that
out repo was created from.

A pull request allows you to share specific changes between two archives.  The github 
web service helps you to create pull requests and then to merge them into the desired
repo.  It also manages the communications required for design reviews and escalation
path.
