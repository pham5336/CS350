Microsoft Visual Studio	Microsoft provides a free version of Visual Studio called the Community edition that supports plugins and is available at no cost.	 It accepts plug-ins that enhance the functionality at almost every level—including adding support for source control systems (like Subversion) and adding new toolsets.	Visual Studio allows developers to write extensions for Visual Studio to extend its capabilities. These extensions "plug into" Visual Studio and extend its functionality.	Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists.
JavaScript Framework	The majority of websites employ it, and all modern web browsers support it without the need for plug-ins by means of a built-in JavaScript engine.	All modern Web browsers support JavaScript with built-in interpreters.	Almost all JavaScript libraries are released under either a copycenter or copyleft license to ensure license-free distribution, usage, and modification.	Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of World Wide Web content production.
Ajax	The term Ajax has come to represent a broad group of Web technologies that can be used to implement a Web application that communicates with a server in the background, without interfering with the current state of the page.	The DOM is accessed with JavaScript to dynamically display – and allow the user to interact with – the information presented.	A variety of popular JavaScript libraries, including JQuery, include abstractions to assist in executing Ajax requests.	With Ajax, Web applications can send data to and retrieve from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page

Cost of Learning
Assess your experience level by counting hours you have spent using each tool or technology.

For each technology that you have spent less than 100 hours with, add 16 hours to the project cost estimate.

Total the number of hours you will need to learn the tools. 

Maximum tools cost = 7 tools * 20 hrs/tool = 140 hours

This is the startup cost that must be paid before you can produce value for the project.

Need to learn: Git, JavaScript, Testing
3 tools * 20 hrs/tool = 60 hours
