Asp.NET
Asp.Net is up and coming, rivaling PHP and JavaScript as a scripting language.	
Asp.NET is gaining ground, especially as Microsoft makes more of the framework open source.	
The community mostly consists of the stack exchange group as well as very good documentation in the MDSN area for Microsoft.
Proficient > 1,000 Hours

Javascript	
Javascript is without question the most widely used framework for client side scripting of web applications.	
Javascript is so widely used it will be an extremely long time before being phased out. 
Especially since sub frameworks are still being developed within Javascript.	
Because Javascript is so widely used there is more than enough information and documentation about anything and everything.	
Competent >100 Hours

MSSQL	
Microsoft SQL is a database system used by some website but more commonly by industrial applications.	
Microsoft SQL is commonly tied to asp.net and therefore its future will grow along with asp.net.	
Because MSSQL uses SQL a lot of the documentation is common to other frameworks. 
In addition, Microsoft has very good documentation.
