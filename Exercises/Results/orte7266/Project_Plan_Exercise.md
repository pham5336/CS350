Login/Registration Page User Story:
	When the user loads up the website and it is detected that they’re not logged in they will be prompted with the login and registration page. The default will be login but if they click the “Create New Account” button the form will change to a registration. If they’re registering then they will be prompted for their first and last name, phone number, email, desired username and password. If they’re logging in they will be prompted for their username and password. Once one of the two forms are validated the user will be redirected to their profile page.
User Profile User Story:
	When the user accesses their profile page they will see their profile picture, description and an archive of their posts. There will also be a form that will allow them to create text posts. When a user creates a text post they will type it into a text box and then when they click submit their profile will automatically update with the new post. If the user wants to edit their profile they can click the edit profile button which will lead to the edit profile page.
Edit Profile User Story:
	The user is led here when they click on the “Edit profile” button on their normal profile page. When they hover over their profile picture they will be prompted to change it. If they choose to they will be asked to select a file from their computer which is then uploaded as their new profile picture. They will also be offered to change their description as a textbox. Updating this will update the profile. All posts will also have x’s next to them that will allow the user to quickly delete any of their posts.
View Others Posts User Story:
	As a part of the main navigation the user will be able to link to a page that shows the posts of other users that the person is connected to. The posts will be sorted by descending post date and the user can scroll through to see them. The user also has the option to un follow the poster so that their posts are no longer displayed in the news feed. The user can also link to the posters page to view their profile and friends. They can also use a search bar to find people that the user may not be following.
